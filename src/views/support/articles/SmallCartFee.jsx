                If your order doesn’t reach a certain minimum price,
                we charge a small cart fee of ₦{cartFee}. In LA,

                Sometimes, we {'don\'t'} know exactly how much your
                items are going to cost at the store. So we may
                quote you the small cart fee but not charge it,
                or we may not quote it, but end up charging it.

                We know this fee can be a bit of a bummer.
                But an easy way to avoid this fee is by signing up
                for Mybukka Unlimited.
                You’ll get free delivery on orders over ₦{percentOnFee} and
                never get hit with a small cart fee again.
