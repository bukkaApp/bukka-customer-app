                    Unrecognized charges can often be tied back to a friend,
                    coworker, or family member who may be using
                    your payment information or a linked account.
                    Please check with your family and friends that may have been
                    previously authorized to use your card.

                    Check your order history to locate the charge.
                    It may be tied to an order {'you\'ve'} placed or a cancellation fee.
                    &nbsp;If you believe you were charged a cancellation fee by mistake,
                    please navigate to Orders &gt; Can I cancel my order.

                    An unrecognized charge may also be a small authorization hold,
                    which is never actually charged to your account,
                    but may appear as {'"pending"'}.
                    All authorization holds are voided within a few business days,
                    depending on your {'bank\'s'} policy. We issue authorization
                    holds as a way to better protect against fraud that may result from
                    unauthorized card usage.
